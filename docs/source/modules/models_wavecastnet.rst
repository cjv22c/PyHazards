WaveCastNet
===========

WaveCastNet is a deep learning model for earthquake wavefield forecasting using 
sequence-to-sequence learning with Convolutional Long Expressive Memory (ConvLEM) cells.

Description
--------

WaveCastNet predicts the future evolution of seismic wavefields for earthquake early 
warning systems. It uses a sequence-to-sequence architecture with ConvLEM cells to:

- Process past wavefield observations (e.g., 60 timesteps of 3-component particle velocity)
- Compress temporal sequences into a latent representation
- Generate future wavefield predictions (e.g., next 60 timesteps)

The model operates on dense spatial grids and is designed for real-time forecasting 
of ground motions without requiring explicit magnitude or epicenter estimation.
